    <h3>Food and drinks?</h3>
    <p>
      Lunch and appetizers are provided; there is a bar, but Hackboat attendees
      are required to pay for their own drinks.
    </p>

    <h3>Internet?</h3>
    <p>There will be internet, but it will be boat internet.</p>

    <h3>Is this an infinitely sized Hackboat?</h3>
    <p>No, there is a limit of 140 people on this Hackboat.</p>

    <h3>How much money are you making from this?</h3>
    <p>
      Ticket costs are structured to just cover costs; sponsorship tiers allow
      us to put on future Hackboat unconferences and are tax deductible since
      this is a BSides event. No money is pocketed by anyone from this, and
      everything over the costs to put this on are put towards the next one (and
      other cool events).
    </p>

    <h3>Where can I find more information about the boat?</h3>
