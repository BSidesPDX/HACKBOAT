      <tr><td><b>FAQ:</b><br><br>

      <p><b>WTF is an unconference?</b><br>
      This is an informal gathering with non-standard activities available to engage in! There will be tables where participants can engage in the level they feel most comfortable. You can play in one of the tabletop games or lead a discussion on your favorite topics, it's up to you!</p>

      <p><b>Does this cost money?</b><br>
      Yes, students are $40, professionals are $100 and there are two tiers for folks who are able to donate more - additional donations over the ticket price are tax deductible!</p>

      <p></p><b>Can I buy tickets later?</b><br>
      It depends on how much later! Due to strict boat law, we need to send over the passenger manifest ahead of time, so May 26th will be the last day to get tickets.</p>

      <p><b>Will there be a free hat?</b><br>
      No, but a sweet free t-shirt is included in your ticket cost if you buy early enough! (for paying attendees only)</p>

      <p><b>What hours will the boat be cruising?</b><br>
      Please look up at the nice table at the top of this page.</p>

      <p><b>How do I get on the boat?</b><br>
      The boat will be docked at the Portland Spirit dock over by OMSI.</p>

      <p><b>Food?</b><br>
      Brunch is provided.</p>

      <p><b>Drinks?</b><br>
      There will be a bar.</p>

      <p><b>Internet?</b><br>
      There will be internet, but it will be boat internet.</p>

      <p><b>Is this an infinitely sized boat?</b><br>
      No, there will a limit of 140 people on this boat.</p>

      <p><b>How much money are you making from this?</b><br>
      All proceeds go to BSides to cover the costs associated with the excursion and additional funds allocated to the next Hackboat or other BSides-funded events. We don't make money on this.</p>

      <p><b>Can I register with my 31337 h4x0r alias?</b><br>
      Sorry, due to strict maritime law, your legal name will need to match the boat manifest.</p>

      <p><b>Are you sure this is a good idea?</b><br>
      Too late to back out now. We have the boat, so it's happening either way.</p>

      <p><b>This FAQ is boring, is there a better one I can read?</b><br>
      The official boat FAQ can be found here: <a href="https://www.portlandspirit.com/faq.php">https://www.portlandspirit.com/faq.php</a> (though it's not necessarily any less boring)</p>
